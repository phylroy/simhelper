= Introduction =

This is a project I started in early 2008. It was a methodology of examining the results from a eQuest/DOE 2.2 simulation. I wanted to create a application that would quickly evaluate the performance of a building from command line simulations. I have created various scripts that tweak the building in one way other another, but was unsatisfied with the reporting mechanisms in eQuest currently. Rather than dig into eQuest source.

Due to the feature rich side of the DOE22 classes, I have decided to make these a library class that is usable in other applications and make them available for everyone to use.
